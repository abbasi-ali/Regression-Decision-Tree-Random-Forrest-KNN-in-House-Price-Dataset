# Regression-Decision-Tree-Random-Forrest-KNN-in-House-Price-Dataset

In this project, I implemented several different machine learning algorithms on the famous house price dataset. <br>

I first performed preprocessing on the data. After testing several algorithms I performed grid search to find the best hyper parameters. <br>

More details are available in the notebook. <br>
